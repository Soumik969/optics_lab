# Optics Lab — Motion Induced Blindness Experiment

A web-based experiment demonstrating **Motion Induced Blindness**, an optical illusion where stationary visual stimuli disappear when surrounded by moving patterns.

## 🔗 Live Link

**Access the experiment here:** [https://Soumik969.github.io/optics_lab/](https://Soumik969.github.io/optics_lab/)

## How It Works

The experiment page is split into two panels:

- **Left panel** — A Google Form for participant responses and data collection.
- **Right panel** — An interactive Motion Induced Blindness demonstration (from [michaelbach.de](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-mib/index.html)).

## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** via the workflow in `.github/workflows/static.yml`. Any push to the `main` branch triggers a new deployment.

### First-Time Setup

Before the workflow can deploy, you must enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. Push a commit to `main` (or re-run the workflow) to trigger the first deployment
